# Contributing to Git Changes Analyzer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Git Changes Analyzer! We welcome contributions from the community and are excited to work with you.

## ü§ù Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful, inclusive, and constructive in all interactions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you have:
- Git installed and configured
- Bash 4.0 or higher
- A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL)
- Basic understanding of shell scripting

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/git-changes-analyzer.git
   cd git-changes-analyzer
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/tddworks/git-changes-analyzer.git
   ```
4. **Create a development branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- üêõ **Bug fixes** - Fix issues or improve reliability
- ‚ú® **New features** - Add new functionality
- üìö **Documentation** - Improve or add documentation
- üé® **UI/UX improvements** - Enhance user experience
- ‚ö° **Performance** - Optimize performance
- üß™ **Tests** - Add or improve test coverage
- üîß **Refactoring** - Code improvements without changing functionality

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your idea is already being worked on
2. **Open an issue** to discuss major changes before implementing
3. **Keep changes focused** - one feature or fix per pull request
4. **Follow our coding standards** (see below)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length**: Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic and functions
- **Variable names**: Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores
- **Function names**: Use descriptive names with underscores

#### Example:
```bash
# Good
function analyze_commit_data() {
    local days=$1
    local author_filter=${2:-""}
    
    # Process git log data
    git log --since="$days days ago" --pretty=format:"%h|%an|%s"
}

# Avoid
function f() {
    # No comments, unclear purpose
    git log --since="$1 days ago"
}
```

### Testing

- Test your changes thoroughly on different scenarios
- Ensure the script works with various git repository states
- Test edge cases (empty repositories, no commits in time range)
- Verify color output works in different terminals

#### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Script runs without errors
- [ ] All menu options work correctly
- [ ] Command-line arguments function properly
- [ ] Colors display correctly
- [ ] Generated reports are properly formatted
- [ ] Error handling works as expected

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update help text if changing command-line options
- Include usage examples for new features

## üìã Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Sync with upstream**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Test thoroughly**:
   ```bash
   # Test basic functionality
   ./git-changes-analyzer.sh --summary
   
   # Test interactive mode
   ./git-changes-analyzer.sh
   ```

3. **Clean commit history**:
   ```bash
   # Squash related commits if needed
   git rebase -i HEAD~n
   ```
